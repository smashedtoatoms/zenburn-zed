# Zenburn-zed

![screenshot](zenburn.png)

Zenburn is a low-contrast color scheme for Emacs, ported to Zed. It's easy on
the eyes and designed to keep you in the zone for long programming sessions.
Zenburn has been ported to many different editors and environments. For more
information and list of derivatives, visit https://kippura.org/zenburnpage.

## Why?

Zenburn as a theme has only ever looked good to me in emacs and vim. Bozhidar
Barsov created this [version](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs) based on
[this version](http://kippura.org/zenburnpage/), and they're the only ones to
get it right. I've attempted to make some version of it for every editor I have
ever used because everyone else gets wild with the colors. It's supposed to be a
low-contrast theme with a warm color tone. Everyone tries to brighten it up, and
they ruin it in the process. I use it because it's the only theme I have found
that doesn't trigger me seeing double or shadows. Anyway, I made this for me and
am sharing it in case anyone else likes it.

## Installation

Drop this into `~/.config/zed/themes/Zenburn.json` and then choose it from
Settings -> Select Theme in the editor.
